# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Project rules

Trust level 1 ("Assistant"): propose, then wait for a human decision before changing more
than one file or running anything that is not on the allow-list in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Commands (pnpm only — never npm or yarn)

- `pnpm dev` — dev server (Turbopack, http://localhost:3000). Never start a second one.
- `pnpm check` — typecheck + lint + tests. Run it before saying a task is done and quote the output.
- `pnpm typecheck` = `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` · `pnpm lint` = `eslint` (`next lint` no longer exists) · `pnpm test` = `vitest run`
- `pnpm agent:log` — summary of `.agent-log/actions.jsonl`: what you actually did this session.

## Definition of done

- `pnpm check` is green; new behaviour has a test next to the code (`*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`).
- Evidence, not claims: report the command you ran and its exit code / test count.

## Next.js 16 rules that differ from what you may remember

- `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, `headers()` are async — always `await` them.
- Request interception is `proxy.ts` (exports `proxy`), not `middleware.ts`.
- Caching is opt-in (`cacheComponents`, `'use cache'`) — do not enable it without asking.
- Server Components by default; `'use client'` only for hooks, browser APIs, event handlers.
- When unsure about an API, read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` first (see the block above).

## Conventions the linter does not enforce

- Pure logic lives in `lib/` (no React or Next imports) with a Vitest test beside it; route handlers in `app/api/**/route.ts` stay thin.
- Import alias `@/*` = repo root. Ukrainian UI copy; English code, comments and commit messages.
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`), one logical change per commit.

## Boundaries

- Ask before: adding a dependency, editing `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json` or CI.
- Never: touch `.env*` (a hook blocks it anyway), delete tests or disable lint rules to get green, `git push --force`, `rm -rf`.
- Do not edit the managed Next.js block above — `next dev` re-adds it.

<!-- Maintainers: keep everything below the managed block under ~50 lines. Add a rule only after the
     agent gets something wrong twice. No repo overview, no file map, no linter rules, no API docs. -->
